## 0.3.0 / December 2008

  * Add support for public and private cache control directives. Responses
    marked as explicitly public are cached even when the request includes
    an Authorization or Cookie header. Responses marked as explicitly private
    are considered uncacheable.

  * Added a "private_headers" option that dictates which request headers
    trigger default "private" cache control processing. By default, the
    Cookie and Authorization headers are included. Headers may be added or
    removed as necessary to change the default private logic.

  * Adhere to must-revalidate/proxy-revalidate cache control directives by
    not assigning the default_ttl to responses that don't include freshness
    information. This should let us begin using default_ttl more liberally
    since we can control it using the must-revalidate/proxy-revalidate directives.

  * Use the s-maxage Cache-Control value in preference to max-age when
    present. The ttl= method now sets the s-maxage value instead of max-age.
    Code that used ttl= to control freshness at the client needs to change
    to set the max-age directive explicitly.

  * Enable support for X-Sendfile middleware by responding to #to_path on
    bodies served from disk storage. Adding the Rack::Sendfile component
    upstream from Rack::Cache will result in cached bodies being served
    directly by the web server (instead of being read in Ruby).

  * BUG: MetaStore hits but EntityStore misses. This would 500 previously; now
    we detect it and act as if the MetaStore missed as well.

  * Implement low level #purge method on all concrete entity store
    classes -- removes the entity body corresponding to the SHA1 key
    provided and returns nil.

  * Basically sane handling of HEAD requests. A HEAD request is never passed
    through to the backend except when transitioning with pass!. This means
    that the cache responds to HEAD requests without invoking the backend at
    all when the cached entry is fresh. When no cache entry exists, or the
    cached entry is stale and can be validated, the backend is invoked with
    a GET request and the HEAD is handled right before the response
    is delivered upstream.

  * BUG: The Age response header was not being set properly when a stale
    entry was validated. This would result in Age values that exceeded
    the freshness lifetime in responses.

  * BUG: A cached entry in a heap meta store could be unintentionally
    modified by request processing since the cached objects were being
    returned directly. The result was typically missing/incorrect header
    values (e.g., missing Content-Type header). [dkubb]

  * BUG: 304 responses should not include entity headers (especially
    Content-Length). This is causing Safari/WebKit weirdness on 304
    responses.

  * BUG: The If-None-Match header was being ignored, causing the cache
    to send 200 responses to matching conditional GET requests.

## 0.2.0 / 2008-10-24 / Initial Release

  * Document events and transitions in `rack/cache/config/default.rb`

  * EntityStore: store entity bodies keyed by SHA
  * MetaStore: store response headers keyed by URL
  * Last-Modified/ETag validation
  * Vary support
  * Implement error! transition
  * New Rack::Cache::Core
  * memcached meta and entity store implementations
  * URI based storage configuration
  * Read options from Rack env if present (rack-cache.XXX keys)
  * `object` is now `entry`
  * Documentation framework and website

## 0.1.0 / 2008-07-21 / Proof of concept (unreleased)

  * Basic core with event support
  * `#import` method for bringing in config files
  * Freshness based expiration
  * RFC 2616 If-Modified-Since based validation

    Proxy-Authorization, TE, Trailers, Transfer-Encoding, Upgrade
